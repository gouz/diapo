## Image + attributes

With a ``!````image(path of your image)`` at the beginning of a line will display

!image(SD.png, 20, 16.2)

and you can specify width (in vw), height (in vh), and styles,  ``!````image(path, 20, 16.2, float:left;)``

## List

- list
-- sublist
-- sub
- end of a List
-- an other sublist

## Notes for speakers

With conventional comments ``/````*`` end ``*````/``, you can write your speaker note for each slide

/*
My notes will be displayed on speaker view only

It can be multiline now
*/

/*
Multiple comments available
