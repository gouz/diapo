A Slide is define by a line which starts with 2 '#' and a space after

## Image + attributes

With a ``!````image(path of your image)`` at the beginning of a line will display

!image(SD.png)

and you can specify width (in vw), height (in vh), and styles,  ``!````image(path, 20, 10, float:left;)``

## List

- list
-- sublist
-- sub
- end of a List
-- an other sublist

## Notes for speakers

With conventional comments ``/````*`` end ``*````/``, you can write your speaker note for each slide

/*
My notes will be displayed on speaker view only

It can be multiline now
*/

## Components

With a ``componenents/myComponent.mjs`` file, you can create custom component like ``!````test(my test)`` giving this:
